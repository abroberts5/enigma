# enigma

Functionality - 3

Enigma class holds the encrypt and decrypt methods which pull from other classes
to check and adjust keys and offsets where needed. Command line interface works
with key and offset info.

Object Oriented Programming - 3

There are 4 classes broken out and one functional class that was not ultimately
needed. There were two methods exactly that had more than 7 lines and they
were the encrypt and decrypt methods. All other methods used helpers to keep them
condensed and still easily readable.

Test Driven Development - 3

I feel I did well with testing functionality before writing code and it helped
get the needed results while testing how helper methods would react to input
from other methods. So happy we learned this way of coding because it keeps you
from getting stuck on functionality that is probably not needed in the long run.

Version Control - 3

I created 5 branches though I only had about 42 commits. I'm sure I could've
done more though I didn't want to let go of my thought process at times. I
also had about 8 pull requests down to master while moving through the
iterations.
