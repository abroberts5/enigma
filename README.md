**The Key**

_Each message uses a unique encryption key_

_The key is five digits, like 41521_

_The first two digits of the key are the “A” rotation (41)_

_The second and third digits of the key are the “B” rotation (15)_

_The third and fourth digits of the key are the “C” rotation (52)_

_The fourth and fifth digits of the key are the “D” rotation (21)_


**The Offsets**

_The date of message transmission is also factored into the encryption_

_Consider the date in the format DDMMYY, like 240818_

_Square the numeric form (57993309124) and find the last four digits (9124)_

_The first digit is the “A offset” (9)_

_The second digit is the “B offset” (1)_

_The third digit is the “C offset” (2)_

_The fourth digit is the “D offset” (4)_
