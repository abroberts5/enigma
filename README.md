**The Key**

_Each message uses a unique encryption key
The key is five digits, like 41521
The first two digits of the key are the “A” rotation (41)
The second and third digits of the key are the “B” rotation (15)
The third and fourth digits of the key are the “C” rotation (52)
The fourth and fifth digits of the key are the “D” rotation (21)_

**The Offsets**

_The date of message transmission is also factored into the encryption
Consider the date in the format DDMMYY, like 240818
Square the numeric form (57993309124) and find the last four digits (9124)
The first digit is the “A offset” (9)
The second digit is the “B offset” (1)
The third digit is the “C offset” (2)
The fourth digit is the “D offset” (4)_
